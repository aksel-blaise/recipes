When not at work, climbing, running, or riding one of my bikesbut most of the time, even when at work, climbing, running, or riding one of my bikesI am thinking about food. My interest in ingredients has become more keen since my daughter entered the picture; however, my interest in food (generally) has always been fed by raw, and often delicious, curiosity. -Zac SELDEN The bulk of those recipes included in this repository are not my own, and many come from family, friends, and colleagues from across the globe. This repository also includes a great number of recipes that I have happened across during countless midnight hours of scavenging internet cooking sites searching for a very specific type of dish (usually something that we have run across in our travels). Through using Git (and GitHub), I can experiment and tinker with each recipe until I get it just right (for us), andat the end of that journeycan look back through each iterative improvement. In every instance, the original, or initial, commit (init) includes the original recipe and, where relevant, a link to the source. Subsequent commits are added as I edit the text (edit), or alter the original recipe (revise), and the comments on those commits are where changes to the original recipe are detailed.

Whether used on roasted poblano and peanut butter sandwiches, as a dip for vegetables, or as an ingredient in a complex dish, it can be a delicious snack or a main course on a long bike ride. I do tinker quite a bit with this recipe. For the holidays, a little bit of cinnamon and clove adds a nice touch. Peanut butter can always be sweetened with honey, and some folks I know and live with also enjoy the addition of cocoa. 2.1.1 Gear You will need a food processor, spatula, and a Mason jar or other sealable container for your PB. 2.1.2 Ingredients 2 cups of peanuts (whatever you fancy) 1 small pinch of salt 1 tablespoon of olive oil (optional - yields a creamier PB for breads) 1 tablespoon honey (optional - yields a sweeter PB) 1 tablespoon cocoa powder (or some chocolate chips) for the chocolate variety 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and a pinch of clove for the holiday variety 2.1.3 Instructions If you would like to roast the peanuts, do that first. Heat your oven to 350 degrees (F), and watch for the color to change to a glossy light brown. This should take around 10 minutes. Place the peanuts into the food processor, and pulse for five minutes (use the spatula to scrape down the sides as needed), then add the optional oil, honey, cocoa powder, cinnamon/clove, and pulse for another three minutes until silky. Taste the mix, and alter the ingredients until you are happy with it. Tinker freely, and make it your own. If you prefer chunky peanut butter, add 1/4 cup of peanuts, and pulse the processor for just a moment until the desired consistency is achieved. Transfer your PB to the sealable container, and dig in. "],["references.html", "References", " References "]]
