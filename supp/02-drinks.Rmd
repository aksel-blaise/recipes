## Wasail (Hot Spiced Wine)

This recipe comes from the kitchen of Mary McAdams.

_Important: use a slow cooker, but do not bring to a boil_

  *   2 quarts/8 cups burgundy wine
  *   1 quart/4 cups water
  *   1.5 cups sugar
  *   12 cloves (whole)
  *   2 tablespoons cinnamon
  *   6 cinnamon sticks
  *   1 or 2 oranges/sliced

Note: some folks put the oranges into the wine; we squeeze an orange or two into the mix (Lauren is not a fan of pulp).
