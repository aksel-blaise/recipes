# recipes

Food lies among those topics that I enjoy thinking about most. When not at work, climbing, running, or riding my bike--but most of the time, even when at work, climbing, running, or riding my bike--I am thinking about food. My interest in ingredients has become keen since my daughter entered the picture; however, my interest in food (in general) has always been fed by raw, and often delicious, curiosity.

The bulk of those recipes included in this repository are not my own, and many come from family and friends from across the globe. This repository also includes a great number of recipes that I have happened across during countless midnight hours of scavenging internet cooking sites searching for a very specific type of dish (usually something that we have run across in our travels). Through using Git (and GitHub), I can experiment and tinker with each recipe until I get it just right (for us), and--at the end of that journey--can look back through each iterative improvement. In every instance, the original, or initial, commit (init) includes the original recipe. Subsequent commits are added as I alter the original recipe, and the comments on those commits are where changes to the original recipe are detailed.

Eat well, friends.
